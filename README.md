# Works-on-React-and-Related-Technologies

Welcome to the Works-on-React-and-Related-Technologies repository! This repository contains various React projects, each residing in different branches. The purpose of this repository is to showcase different applications, components, and utilities built using React and related technologies.

## Repository Structure

The repository follows a branch-per-project structure, where each project is located in a separate branch. This approach allows for easy navigation and isolation of the different projects. Each branch contains a specific React project along with its associated code and documentation.

And there are explanatory README.md files created according to the project structure in the "code" folder in each project. You can always read these files for information about the project.
